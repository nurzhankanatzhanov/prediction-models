# Comparison of Classification Models
This is a Jupyter Notebook in which I compare multiple classification methods in Python using UCI's [Wisconsin breast cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29) for prediction. 
The candidate methods that I analyze and compare are:
 - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 🙋‍♂️
 - Decision Trees 🌲
 - Random Forest 🌴🌲🌳
 - Polynomial Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 📈
 - Gaussian Kernel (RBF) Support Vector Machines 📉
 - Deep Neural Network w/ sigmoid activation function 🌎
 - Deep Neural network w/ ReLu activation function 🌐

You can also find my report in a PDF attached in this repository.
