# Comparison of Classification Models
This is a Jupyter Notebook in which I compare multiple classification methods in Python using UCI's Wisconsin breast cancer dataset for prediction. 
The candidate methods that I analyze and compare are:
 - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
 - Decision Trees
 - Random Forest
 - Polynomial Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
 - Gaussian Kernel (RBF) Support Vector Machines
 - Deep Neural Network w/ sigmoid activation function
 - Deep Neural network w/ ReLu activation function

You can also find my report in a PDF attached in this repository.
